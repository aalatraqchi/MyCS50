                Over the summer, in about the middle of August, I began Roblox scripting using Luau. Lua is a simple programming language and luau is just Roblox's twist on the lua language
                with their own events and methods added. I learned lua first and then transitioned to practicing in Roblox Studio by scripting with their parts and variety of services. I immediately
                decided to start a big project with the help of my older brother, an obstacle course.  It is the simplest and arguably the easiest Roblox game to build for amateurs.
                I continued to learn scripting on Roblox while learning the fundamentals of programming in CS50 as my brother began building the obstacle course structure and adding all
                the parts necessary. I then started to make it unique by scripting every level differently by adding movement and utilizing physics, something I haven't found in any other obby
                yet. This is my ongoing project that I would like to finish and hopefully enhance my skills enough to make many other, more complex, Roblox games. <br> <br> Click on the Roblox
